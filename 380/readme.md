# 380. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)

**Medium**

Implement the RandomizedSet class:

- `RandomizedSet()` Initializes the `RandomizedSet` object.
- `bool insert(int val)` Inserts an item `val` into the set if not present. Returns `true` if the item was not present, `false` otherwise.
- `bool remove(int val)` Removes an item `val` from the set if present. Returns `true` if the item was present, `false` otherwise.
- `int getRandom()` Returns a random element from the current set of elements (it's guaranteed that at least one element exists when this method is called). Each element must have the same probability of being returned.

You must implement the functions of the class such that each function works in average `O(1)` time complexity.


### `Personal note 1`

This took a while for me to understand. The concept isn't difficult, however the structure is. Breaking down the functions to specialized tasks was the most challenging.


### `Personal note 2`

Computer crashed. Took a while to set up the system again. I'm lazy AF.
